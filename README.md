## Usage

The AutoRefresh addon for Zotero offers a user-friendly and intuitive experience. All the necessary functionalities can be accessed conveniently through the context menu, which is available by simply right-clicking anywhere within the Zotero window. 

The 'Archive' field plays a temporary role in the AutoRefresh addon, serving to indicate the refresh status of items. It utilizes symbols such as [üîÑ] for refreshing, [‚úîÔ∏è] for refreshed, and [‚ùå] for items that could not be refreshed. To conveniently monitor the status of items, it is recommended to enable the 'Archive' field on the list interface. This will provide a clear and accessible view of the item's refresh status. Rest assured, once the refresh process is complete, you can effortlessly remove the symbols inserted in the 'Archive' field. This can be done by accessing the context menu and selecting the option "Clear all AutoRefresh Tags (üîÑ ‚úîÔ∏è ‚ùå) from 'Archive' Field". This convenient feature ensures that you can easily clear the temporary symbols from the 'Archive' field, maintaining a clean and organized view of your items.

There are basically 3 AutoRefresh context-menu options:


### 1. Update Information Using Identifier (DOI/ISBN)

- Select the desired items in Zotero.
- Right-click on the selected items to open the context menu.
- Choose the "Update information Using Identifier (DOI/ISBN)" option.
- A confirmation alert will appear, asking if you want to proceed with the update.
- If confirmed, the addon will attempt to update the item information based on the DOI/ISBN.
- AutoRefresh tags (üîÑ ‚úîÔ∏è ‚ùå) will be inserted into the 'Archive' field to indicate the update status.
- Check the 'Archive' field to verify which items were successfully updated.

### 2. Clear all AutoRefresh Tags (üîÑ ‚úîÔ∏è ‚ùå) from 'Archive' Field

- Right-click anywhere in Zotero's main interface to open the context menu.
- Choose the "Clear all AutoRefresh Tags (üîÑ ‚úîÔ∏è ‚ùå) from 'Archive' field" option.
- A confirmation alert will appear, asking if you want to proceed with the tag removal.
- If confirmed, the addon will remove all AutoRefresh tags from the 'Archive' field of all items.
- This action will clear any indication of the update status.

### 3. Delete Only PDFs

- Select the desired items in Zotero.
- Right-click on the selected items to open the context menu.
- Choose the "Delete Only PDFs" option.
- A confirmation alert will appear, asking if you want to proceed with the PDF deletion.
- If confirmed, the addon will delete the PDF attachments of the selected items.
- Note that this action only deletes the PDF attachments and does not remove the items themselves.

## Why an item did not get updated (‚ùå)?

If you encounter cases where an item did not get updated and an AutoRefresh tag of ‚ùå (failure) was inserted in the 'Archive' field, there are a few possible reasons:

1. **Invalid or missing DOI/ISBN**: The item may have an invalid or missing DOI/ISBN, which prevents the addon from retrieving the updated information. Double-check the DOI/ISBN of the item and ensure it is accurate and valid.

2. **Unavailable or unrecognized identifier**: The addon relies on the DOI/ISBN to fetch updated information from external sources. If the DOI/ISBN is not recognized or the external source does not have updated information for that specific item, the addon cannot update it. 

3. **Connection or service issues**: The addon requires a stable internet connection to fetch updated information. If there are connectivity issues or the external service used by the addon is experiencing downtime or interruptions, it may result in failed updates. Verify your internet connection and try updating the item again later.

4. **Item type limitations**: The addon works with specific item types. As of now, only journal articles, books and conference papers are supported. If the item type is not supported the update process will fail. Ensure that the item type is supported by the addon and consider checking for updates or improvements to the addon in the future.

If an item did not get updated and you believe it should have, consider checking the above factors to troubleshoot the issue. If the problem persists or you encounter any other difficulties, please refer to the Support section on the addon's GitHub repository.
